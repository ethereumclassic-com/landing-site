        Welcome to Ethereum Classic! This guide will walk you through everything you need to start using ETC, from setting up a wallet to acquiring your first coins and exploring the ecosystem.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Get a Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        Before you can use Ethereum Classic, you need a wallet to store your ETC and interact with decentralized applications. There are several wallet types to choose from:
      </p>

      <h3>Browser Wallets</h3>
      <p>
        For easy access to dApps, browser extension wallets like MetaMask are ideal. MetaMask can be configured to work with Ethereum Classic by adding a custom network:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Name:</strong> Ethereum Classic</li>
        <li><strong>RPC URL:</strong> https://etc.rivet.link</li>
        <li><strong>Chain ID:</strong> 61</li>
        <li><strong>Currency Symbol:</strong> ETC</li>
        <li><strong>Block Explorer:</strong> https://etc.blockscout.com</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The easiest method is to visit chainlist.org/chain/61 and click &ldquo;Connect Wallet&rdquo; to add ETC to MetaMask automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>Mobile Wallets</h3>
      <p>
        For everyday use, Trust Wallet is an easy-to-use mobile option that supports ETC along with many other cryptocurrencies.
      </p>

      <h3>Hardware Wallets</h3>
      <p>
        For larger holdings, hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor provide the best security by keeping your private keys offline.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Acquire ETC</h2>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is listed on virtually every major cryptocurrency exchange. You can acquire ETC through several methods:
      </p>

      <h3>Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h3>
      <p>
        Purchase ETC with fiat currency (USD, EUR, etc.) or trade other cryptocurrencies on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and many others. Check our exchange listings for a complete list.
      </p>

      <h3>Decentralized Exchanges</h3>
      <p>
        Use DEXs like ETCswap to swap other tokens for ETC directly from your wallet without creating an account.
      </p>

      <h3>Mining</h3>
      <p>
        If you have a modern graphics card, you can mine ETC and earn it as block rewards. Check our mining guides for details.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3: Secure Your Wallet</h2>
      <p>
        Security is paramount in cryptocurrency. Follow these essential practices:
      </p>

      <h3>Backup Your Seed Phrase</h3>
      <p>
        Your seed phrase (usually 12 or 24 words) is the master key to your wallet. Write it down on paper and store it securely offline. Never share it with anyone or store it digitally.
      </p>

      <h3>Verify Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        Always double-check addresses before sending transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Hardware Wallets for Savings</h3>
      <p>
        Keep only what you need for regular use in hot wallets. Store larger amounts on hardware wallets.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 4: Explore the Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have ETC, you can explore the growing ecosystem of applications:
      </p>

      <h3>DeFi</h3>
      <p>
        Decentralized finance applications let you swap tokens, provide liquidity, and earn yield. ETCswap is the primary DEX on Ethereum Classic.
      </p>

      <h3>dApps</h3>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic supports the same smart contracts as Ethereum, meaning many Ethereum applications can run on ETC. Browse our apps section for available services.
      </p>

      <h3>NFTs</h3>
      <p>
        Create, buy, and sell non-fungible tokens on ETC-native NFT marketplaces.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding ETC Basics</h2>

      <h3>What is Ether?</h3>
      <p>
        Ether is Ethereum Classic&apos;s native token, traded as ETC. It&apos;s created as mining rewards and used to pay for operations like deploying smart contracts and sending transactions.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Gas?</h3>
      <p>
        Gas is an internal transaction pricing mechanism that mitigates spam and allocates network resources. Every transaction requires gas, measured in units representing the computational effort required. You pay for gas in ETC.
      </p>

      <h3>Block Explorers</h3>
      <p>
        You can view your transactions and account balance on BlockScout, the most popular Ethereum Classic block explorer, at etc.blockscout.com.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Help</h2>
      <p>
