      <p>
        Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). As the continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain, ETC maintains the principle of &ldquo;Code is Law&rdquo; and operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>The Original Ethereum</h2>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum network that has been running continuously since July 2015. It preserves the unaltered history of the Ethereum blockchain and maintains the foundational principles that made Ethereum revolutionary: immutability, decentralization, and censorship resistance.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features</h2>

      <h3>Proof-of-Work Security</h3>
      <p>
        ETC uses the ETChash mining algorithm, a proof-of-work system that secures the network through computational power. This makes Ethereum Classic one of the largest proof-of-work smart contract platforms, providing robust security and true decentralization.
      </p>

      <h3>Smart Contract Platform</h3>
      <p>
        Like Ethereum, ETC supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy and execute smart contracts. This means existing Ethereum dApps can be easily deployed on Ethereum Classic with minimal modifications.
      </p>

      <h3>Fixed Monetary Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic has a known, fixed monetary policy with a maximum supply cap. The emission schedule follows a deflationary model, with block rewards reducing by 20% every 5 million blocks. This predictable supply makes ETC a sound money alternative in the smart contract space.
      </p>

      <h3>Immutability</h3>
      <p>
        The core principle of Ethereum Classic is that the blockchain should be immutable. Transactions that have been confirmed on the network cannot be reversed or altered. This principle ensures that applications running on ETC operate exactly as programmed, without interference.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Proof-of-Work Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Proof-of-work provides several important benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Mining requires real-world resources, making attacks economically expensive</li>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Anyone with hardware can participate in securing the network</li>
        <li><strong>Censorship Resistance:</strong> No central authority can prevent valid transactions</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Distribution:</strong> New coins are distributed to those who contribute computational work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The ETC Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Ethereum Classic has a growing ecosystem of applications and services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ETCswap:</strong> Decentralized exchange for token swaps and liquidity provision</li>
        <li><strong>Classic USD (USC):</strong> Native stablecoin backed 1:1 by USD</li>
        <li><strong>Classic OS:</strong> Economic control center for DeFi and portfolio management</li>
        <li><strong>Olympia DAO:</strong> Decentralized governance for the ecosystem</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started with ETC</h2>
      <p>
        Ready to start using Ethereum Classic? Here&apos;s what you need to do:
      </p>
